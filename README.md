## Virtual Neuro Machine

how to build:
```
docker build -t vnm:stable . 
```

how to start local:
```
docker run --privileged -e USER=neuro -e PASSWORD=neuro --name vnm -p 6080:80 vnm:stable 
open in browser: http://localhost:6080
```

how to start with custom screen resolution for VNC Viewer:
```
docker run --privileged -e USER=neuro -e PASSWORD=neuro --name vnm -e RESOLUTION=1920x980 -p 6080:80 -p 5900:5900 vnm:stable 
open in VNC viewer:  http://localhost:5900
```


testing new features:
```
docker run --privileged -e USER=neuro -e PASSWORD=neuro --name vnm_latest -e RESOLUTION=1920x980 -p 6080:80 -p 5900:5900 -v C:/vnm:/vnm vnm:latest 
```

how to stop:
